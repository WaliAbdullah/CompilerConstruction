** Group Members **
1. Wali Mohammad Abdullah  : Partially wrote source files for Phase-4
2. Mohammad Sakib Mahmud   : Partially wrote source files for Phase-4
3. Chowdhury Nawrin Ferdous: Partially wrote source files for Phase-4

** Group Contribution ** 
Together we contributed for planning and designing the project and to write the report on Latex.

** Note **
Our parse tree is presented in ParserOutFile file. Here Root is at the top-left position. 
A child is represented by placing it (1 TAB) distance from its parent. 
Each block is labeled with a number. Also each block has two children-Definitionpart and StatementPart. They are labeled with corresponding block's number.

** Name of the files included**
1. Makefile
2. README
3. Technical_Report_of_Compiler_Construction.pdf
4. Source code (phase-1): administration.cc, administration.h, plc.cc, parser.cc, parser.h, firstfollow.cc, firstfollow.h, scanner.cc, scanner.h, symbol.h, symboltable.cc, symboltable.h, token.cc, token.h 
5. Source code (phase-2): parser.cc, parser.h, firstfollow.cc, firstfollow.h 
6. Source code (phase-3): blocktable.h, blocktable.cc,type.h
7. Source code (phase-4): Assembler.h Assembler.cc interp.h interp.cc [Provided by Dr. Shahadat Hossain sir]
8. Input files: factorial, input1 (taken from lecture), input2 (having some errors intensionally to test error reporting).
9. Output file: ParserOutFile, PL_interFile_<filename>.asm and MachineCode (intermediate code and abstract machine code) 
10. Additional Graduate Project (Printing the structure of the program in parse tree ):ParserOutFile

** Instruction: How to compile and run our code **
$ make clean 			
$ make 	
$ ./compiler <inputFileName> 	
Note: If a non-existing file name is given then compiler takes it as an empty file.
** The  code is free from compile-time and runtime-errors **

** Approximate time (in hours) we spent on this assignment ** 
20-25 hours
